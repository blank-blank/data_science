get a gpu backed deep learning model working on aws

get gpu working:

subscribe to bitfusion ami from marketplace         https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01B52CMSO

Launch instance from bitfusion ami 

     I used g2.2xlarge instance in northern california region - ami-34423254

set up cuda config

    set $CUDA_ROOT to bin folder of cuda installation
    echo "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" 

output:  /usr/local/cuda/lib64

    CUDA_ROOT=”/usr/local/cuda/bin”  #bin folder at same level as above var ^^
 
Add CUDA_ROOT to path:
 PATH="$PATH:$CUDA_ROOT"
nvcc binary must be on path...should be in your CUDA_ROOT

Configure theano to use your gpu by making your ~/.theanorc file look like this:

[global]
device = gpu
floatX = float32

test theano
ran test by copying code at :
http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html#using-gpu

        python test_theano.py 
==================== output ======================================

Using gpu device 0: GRID K520

Used the gpu

pip install keras

git clone https://github.com/BoulderDataScience/data-sci-bowl-2016.git
